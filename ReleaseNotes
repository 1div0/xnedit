Changes in XNEdit 1.0 compared to NEdit 5.7

1. New Features

Text rendering

XNEdit has a new Xft-based text renderer, which uses client-side fonts and
supports antialiased text rendering and fallback fonts.

Unicode

Without specific encoding informations, XNEdit assumes that a file is UTF-8
encoded. This is completely independent of the user's locale setting. There are
several ways to load differently encoded files:

 - If the file uses a different unicode encoding and has a byte order mark,
   XNEdit automatically detects the correct encoding.

 - When using the Open File dialog, you can choose the encoding from a list.

 - XNEdit uses an extended attribute for storing encoding informations. If a
   file has an extended attribute with the name "charset" (or "user.charset"
   on Linux), the value is used as the encoding name.

By default, the "charset" attribute is only stored when using non-unicode
encodings. The Save File dialog allows you to choose if you want to store
the attribute.
